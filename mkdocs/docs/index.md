## Introduction
This script converts ACP10 motor table into a variable structure and hardware file that can be used with mappMotion. The conversion is done automatically and may contain errors or miss some data. It is absolutely crucial to verify the values after the conversion. Make sure to check the comments in the corresponding files since they contain import information about the converted data.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x

Install python by using the guide from the page [installation](installation.md). Use the shell to run the script or use vscode for debugging.
