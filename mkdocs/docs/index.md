## Introduction
This script converts ACP10 motor table into a variable structure that can be used with mappMotion. The conversion is done automatically and may contain errors or miss some data. It is absolutely crucial to verify the values after the conversion. Make sure to check the comments in the corresponding files since they contain import information about the converted data.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x

## Additional Information
